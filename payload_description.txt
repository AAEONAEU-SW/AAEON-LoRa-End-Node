•	Acc-X = FFE0
Starting with FF, it means that the axis is upside down and that the value is negative , to have the true value we make a complement to 2 :

Not(FFE0 - 1) = 0010 which correspond to 16 in decimal
True value = -16

•	Acc-Y = 0050
Not starting with FF, it means that the axis is not upside down and that the value is positive , to have the true value we make a classical conversion hexa->decimal :

True value = 80

•	Acc-X = FC00
Starting with FF, it means that the axis is upside down and that the value is negative , to have the true value we make a complement to 2 :

Not(FC00 - 1) = 0400 which correspond to 1024 in decimal
True value = -1024

After finding the true values, you divide them by 1000 to have the value in acceleration with unit (g) 

Acc-X = - 0,016g 
Acc-Y = - 0,080g
Acc-Z = - 1,024g (around 1g which correspond to earth gravity acceleration)
